# Issue tracker for [@MattWindsor91/roslyn](https://github.com/MattWindsor91/roslyn)

This repo currently exists only to hold an issues tracker for the experimental concepts prototype fork of Roslyn by @crusso and @MattWindsor91.

## Health warning (1 March 2019)

The concepts fork was produced as part of two internships (in 2016 and 2017), and is now fairly outdated.  At time of writing, both original authors are working on different things (but do maintain interest in where this work goes!)

Discussion about where the _concepts_ concepts go from here is, generally, happening in the following upstream issues:

- [Champion "Type Classes (aka Concepts, Structural Generic Constraints)"](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/110)
- [Exploration: Shapes and Extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/164)
